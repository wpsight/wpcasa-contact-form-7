Add support for Contact Form 7 to attach property details to the contact email sent from WPCasa listing pages.

== Description ==

The WPCasa Contact Form 7 add-on is a bridge plugin for the Contact Form 7 form builder that can be used to display a contact form on single listing pages in WPCasa. The add-on makes sure that useful property information is attached to the emails sent through the form. It also comes with a starter form that includes all the necessary fields to make your life easier.

> Please notice that this plugin is an add-on for [WPCasa](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpcasa/) and will NOT work without the core plugin.

WPCasa is a WordPress solution that provides an intuitive way to manage property listings and create first-class real estate websites.
